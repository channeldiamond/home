<p>Garry’s Mod is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110121202414/http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/">50% off</a>. If you’re reading this you probably already have Garry’s Mod so this is useless information for you.</p>
<p>But maybe you have a best friend, who you really care about. Maybe his parents aren’t very good at managing their money and can’t get a bank card. Maybe they spend all their money on clothes and food for their kids, so don’t have enough left over for sandbox based video games. Maybe you gave them your old PC so they can share in your favourite hobby. Maybe you want to make their Christmas extra special. Maybe they have played Garry’s Mod around your house and really loved it – but you want to play together online all night long. So maybe you buy them the gift that keeps on giving. Buy them Garry’s Mod with Counter-Strike Source.</p>
<p>If you’re playing Garry’s Mod and are finding that you have missing props from some games, like Team Fortress or Counter-Strike, then this would be a good time to grab one of those too – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110121202414/http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/">they’re 50% off too OH WHAT</a></p>

				<p>I’m aware that this has been happening for the last 6 hours, since Valve updated the engine. I’m going to head into the office right now to look into it and see if I can get a patch to fix it.</p>
<p>This is the cost of being on the newest version of the Source engine. It’s going to happen sometimes. But I’d rather have a days downtime every 6 months than be on a 2 year old version of the Source engine. I hope you agree. I’ll edit this post with updates as I get them.</p>
<p><b>09:18</b> – Got into the office. Looking into the issue.<br>
<b>09:24</b> – Apparently mdlcache is NULL. Uh-oh. Merging code with Valve’s latest.<br>
<b>09:56</b> – Merging code. It’s slow shoving code about on SVN.<br>
<b>10:07</b> – Chatting in the steam chat while I’m waiting – join it <a class="linkAction steamLink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110121202414/steam://friends/joinchat/103582791430264201">here</a><br>
<b>10:18</b> – 200 people in <a class="linkAction steamLink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110121202414/steam://friends/joinchat/103582791430264201">chat</a>, it’s unchattable. Merging code now, going well so far.<br>
<b>10:37</b> – Merge was successful, committing, then I’ll try to compile it, then fix any errors. Then hopefully we should be ready.<br>
<b>10:38</b> – PC is compiling fine – mac is complaining: “ld: library not found for -l-liconv”<br>
<b>11:21</b> – After much head scratching – I think I have fixed the OSX build. Testing now.<br>
<b>11:41</b> – SVN version should work properly now<br>
<b>11:52</b> – Waiting for OSX build to complete<br>
<b>12:09</b> – .. and I’m done! I’ve done everything I can. It’s in Valve’s hands now. I’ve emailed everyone I know there to tell them there’s an update that needs to go out but I don’t know whether they work on a Saturday. Wish they’d let us push our own updates out! Oh well, fingers crossed that it fixes everything!</p>

<p>Yesterday’s patch seems to have gone pretty smoothly. No widespread problems. A few reports of Lua errors – which seem to be isolated to single configurations.</p>
<p>Those people that had PHX installed are advised to remove the old installation. If you have duplicate spawn categories in the spawnmenu you can remove them by right clicking on them.</p>
<p>Anything else? Hit the comments or email me.</p>

<p>First of all, last month while I was on holiday it was GMod’s 4th Birthday! Well, kind of. It was 4 years ago since it was released on Steam. Thanks to Emanuel for the picture!</p>
<p>This patch is kind of a big deal, here’s the changes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Added PHX content pack<br>
Changed default loading screen<br>
sv_client_predict now defaults to 1<br>
Ragdolls now copy skin, blood colour, material<br>
No longer crashes when modelprecache is full (instead refuses to load new models)<br>
Disabled scriptenforcer when playing demos<br>
Fixed ‘out of edicts’ error – won’t create new entities if we’re near the limit<br>
Servers can now define a loading screen for people joining their server (sv_loadingurl)</p>
<p>[Lua] Fixed not being able to turn off player shadows<br>
[Lua] Added GAMEMODE:CalcViewModelView hook<br>
[Lua] Added ViewModel:ViewModelIndex()<br>
[Lua] Lua entities can override regular entities (when named the same)<br>
[Lua] Added Entity:StopParticleEmission()<br>
[Lua] Added Entity::CreateParticleEffect( strName, iAttachmentType, tabControlPoints )<br>
[Lua] Fixed bug in render.RenderView which meant that after enabling ortho mode you couldn’t turn it off again<br>
[Lua] Added GAMEMODE:PlayerCanPickupItem</p>
<p>[TTT] Added first person ragdoll cam.<br>
[TTT] Added ability for Traitors to hang corpses on walls with the Magneto-stick.<br>
[TTT] Added Glock automatic pistol.<br>
[TTT] Added “X is innocent” radio command.<br>
[TTT] Added “Call detective” button to corpses.<br>
[TTT] Added debug messages to TTT entities for mappers (set “developer 2″).<br>
[TTT] Added check that forces sv_alltalk off if it’s on.<br>
[TTT] Changed gun ironsight positions to be lower (disable in settings).<br>
[TTT] Fixed flaregun scorch marks often not showing up.<br>
[TTT] Fixed thrown explosive barrel kills sometimes being attributed to victim instead of thrower.<br>
[TTT] Fixed Fretta map-only vote restarting while in progress.<br>
[TTT] Fixed ttt_damageowner not working well for certain physics-based traps.</p></blockquote>
<p>The biggest change being the addition of PHX’s content pack. This includes props, materials, thruster models, wheel models and button models. I don’t want to ruin the fun of exploring these things, so I won’t say much more about them. Thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110121202414/http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix-storms">PhoeniX-Storms</a> and his team for allowing us to add this content!</p>
<p>The load screen is now a HTML page. This means, sadly, that the walking icons accross the screen are gone. But on the plus side it means that the load screen is now totally customizable to server owners, and if they want walking icons they should be able to do it with some javascript magic (javascript is fired into the page when a file starts downloading etc).</p>
<p>As usual, let me know of any troubles in the comments or by email and I’ll fix them up as soon as possible.</p>

<p>There won’t be any Garry’s Mod updates for the next two or three weeks – since I’m going on holiday. I don’t want to break something and not be able to fix it, so I’m going to play it safe. </p>
<p>See ya in a few weeks!</p>

<p>Before Garry’s Mod cost ten bux on Steam it was a free mod. </p>
<p>Overv has documented the 9 previous version in his epic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110121202414/http://www.constructivenews.net/?p=554">news post over at ConstructiveNews.net</a>. It’s an interesting read for anyone that was around at that time. It was especially interesting for me, since although I’d made all these versions I’d forgot about a lot of the things that are mentioned.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110121202414/http://www.constructivenews.net/?p=554">check it out</a>, GMod fans!</p>

<p>It seems that yesterday’s patch went pretty much without a hitch. People are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110121202414/http://toybox.garrysmod.com/ingame/?show=savemap&amp;tiertwo=newest">happily uploading their saves, along with screenshots</a>.</p>
<p>The only problem is that people seem to be having trouble with the new scriptenforcer system. The ConVar no longer directly controls script enforcer. You need to set it, then reload the map. So if scriptenforcer isn’t working for you then this is likely the problem.</p>
<p>If there are any other problems, please let me know in the comments!</p>

<p>Another update coming tonight! I wasn’t going to release an update for a few weeks but this one should FINALLY fix the ‘this shouldn’t happen’ bug with Toybox. There’s a couple of other good things in there and some requests.</p>
<blockquote><p>Toybox Save now uploads a screenshot<br>
Added cleanup and save buttons to Toybox Save<br>
Changed Toybox auth system to be less error prone<br>
Changed how scriptenforcer works internally to be more secure<br>
Fixed crash in physics_npc_solver when loading a Toybox Save</p>
<p>[Lua] Player:GetPunchAngle() is now shared<br>
[Lua] Fixed bitshifting not working on variables<br>
[Lua] Added Entity:FindTransitionSequence()</p></blockquote>
<p>Servers will need to be restarted!</p>
